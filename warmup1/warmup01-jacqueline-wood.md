Fries can be eaten year round, but are a popular summer food.

There are variations of the recipe that involve peeking, soaking, twice-frying, temperature monitoring etc. but those recipes are not as easy. Most recipes involve similar ingredients.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\bar{pq}$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

d(p,q) = d(q,p) = $\\sqrt{(q\_{1} - p\_{1})^2 + (q\_{2} - p\_{2})^2 + ... + (q\_{n} - p\_{n})^2}$ = $\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_{i} - p\_{i})^2}$
