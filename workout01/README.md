# README: Workout 01: GSW Shot Charts
## Stat 133, Spring 2019

This Stat 133 HW (Workout 01) involves
1. working with a complex file structure and uploading files to GitHUb
2. visualizing shot data of NBA Golden State Warriors players
3. producing a report document with a narrative

## Data
The original data was loaded in using five csvs of player data. The five csvs are:
* andre-iguodala.csv
* draymond-green.csv
* kevin-durant.csv
* klay-thompson.csv
* stephen-curry.csv

The data above is described in data-dictionary.md.

Then using the script in make-shots-data-script.R the above csvs were combined into one csv called shot-data.csv.

## Charts
From there, the script in make-shot-charts-script.R was used to make meaningful shot charts of the five players to visualize their shooting locations.

## Report
The final narrative describing the findings and including the plots is included in workout01-first-last.Rmd.
